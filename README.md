# cnn-image-classifier
In this Project I have used PyTorch to create a CNN Architecture roughly derived from VGG-16 to classify Bird Images. The model shows an Accuracy of about 86% on Validation set and around 93% on Train set after 20 epochs. <br />
Furthermore to visualize the working of our model, I have used GradCam to generate heatmaps on images that show which image parts are more dominant in producing the output. <br /><br />

To understand more about GradCam please look at https://github.com/jacobgil/pytorch-grad-cam <br />
